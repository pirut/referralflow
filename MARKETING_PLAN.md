## Outreach Templates

### Reddit Post - Initial
```
Title: Built a free tool to track referrals for local businesses — would love feedback

Body:
I keep hearing from local business friends that referrals are their #1 source of new customers, but it nobody can actually track.

So I built ReferralFlow:

- Give customers unique referral codes
- Track who brings in new business
- Auto-reward your best customers
- See analytics on your top referrers

It's still free for early users. Would love to get it in front of some real business owners.

Any interest? Happy to give free access to the first 10 people who want to try it.
```

### Cold Email Template
```
Subject: Quick question about your referrals

Hi [NAME],

I'm building a tool for [INDUSTRY] businesses to track referrals automatically.

Most places we talk to use spreadsheets or just "ask around" — which works until you realize you've got customers who've referred 20 people and never got so much as a thank-you.

Wanted to ask: How do you currently track who refers new customers? Would you be open to trying a free tool that does this for you?

No pressure either way.

Best,
[Your Name]
ReferralFlow
```

### Follow-up Email
```
Subject: Following up on referral tracking

Hi [NAME],

Just wanted to bump this — wanted to see if you had any thoughts on referral tracking?

If it's not a priority right now, no worries. But if it's something you deal with, I'd love to chat.

Best,
[Your Name]
```
