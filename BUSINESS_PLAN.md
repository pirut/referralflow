## Problem

Local businesses survive on referrals:
- 65% of new customers come from word-of-mouth
- But tracking referrals is painful:
  - Staff forget to ask "who referred you?"
  - Spreadsheets get messy
  - Rewards are inconsistent or forgotten
  - No insight into who's actually bringing business

**Result:** Businesses lose thousands in untracked referrals and inconsistent rewards.
